## DEEPFAKE DETECTION USING DEEP LEARNING
#### Introduction: 
Deepfake technology, powered by advanced deep learning algorithms, has emerged as a major threat to society.Deepfakes are synthetic media in which a person in an existing image or video is replaced with someone else.This project focuses on detection of video deepfakes using deep learning based models  CNN, ResNext and LSTM.
#### System Architecture:
